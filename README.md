# Identification of toxic mushrooms with machine learning

In this project I want to introduce you a little web application to anaylze data from toxic mushrooms.
You can use different algorithms to evaluate them.

I have build an interactive web application with Streamlit and Python,
- Train Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Classifiers using scikit-learn
- Plot evaluation metrics for binary classification algorithms
